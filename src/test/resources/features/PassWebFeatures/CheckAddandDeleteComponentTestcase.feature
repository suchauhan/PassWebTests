Feature: Verify Add and Delete Component Functionality

  Scenario Outline: Check AddAndDeleteComponent functionality from Sales Draft to Sales Final
    Given I am logged in as a "ssocommercial" user in SSO
    When I search an existing LQ commercial Opportunity
    When I create a new NSP
    And I move to PASS through SFA
    Then I should be in PASS and create the NSP in PASS
    And I add the competitor info
    When I select "<Entity>" and "<Product>" and adding it manually
    Then Product should get added
    And Component Row should get added
    And Component Row should get Deleted
